# GeraltOfRivia

This project aims to determine the armor set of the highest value based on available currency. The armor set consists of one piece of armor for each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet and Boots) as well as extra piece that can be of any type.

The project uses Node.js, MySQL as data input and storage, as well as other NPM packages to run the CLI app.

To execute from the command line:
`node armorShop.js`
